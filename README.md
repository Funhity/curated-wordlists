# curated-wordlists
A monorepo of useful wordlists for security testing, updated from their original sources daily via GitHub Actions. 

*If you have any recommendations for wordlists to be added, post [here](https://github.com/cxosmo/curated-wordlists/issues) and I'll look to add them. GitHub file size limitations have resulted in some large collections being ommitted (e.g. [Assetnote wordlists > 100MB](https://wordlists.assetnote.io/)).*

# Thanks
A huge thanks to all the original sources from which these wordlists are derived (see [main.yml](https://github.com/cxosmo/curated-wordlists/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) for sources)!
